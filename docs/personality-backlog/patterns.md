# Companion-AI patterns to explore

Design patterns we haven't tried yet. Each entry is intentionally one
short paragraph plus key files / tables it would touch — not an
implementation plan. Pick one and turn it into a real plan with a
fresh `CreatePlan` invocation when it's time.

The patterns are loosely ordered by how cleanly they fit on top of
already-shipped infrastructure (low K-numbers piggyback on existing
plumbing; later K-numbers introduce more new shape).

Shipped — see [`shipped.md`](shipped.md) "K8. Affect rupture-and-repair
— \"their mood just dipped\"".

---

## K9. Topic-graph / interest-network browser

Build a lightweight cosine-cluster graph of memories so Aiko can
notice "this topic touches three threads we've been on" and surface
connections naturally. Reuses the embeddings already in
[`app/core/rag/rag_store.py`](../../app/core/rag/rag_store.py); the graph
itself is computed lazily and cached. UI side: a minimal "topic
graph" sub-tab in the Memory tab that visualises clusters so the user
can see what Aiko sees. Key files: new
`app/core/conversation/topic_graph.py`, [`app/core/rag/rag_retriever.py`](../../app/core/rag/rag_retriever.py)
(graph-aware multi-hop retrieval), Memory tab.

---

## K10. Persona regression tests

Periodic golden-prompt evals: a small fixture file
(`data/persona/golden_turns.jsonl`) with a handful of canonical
prompts + expected style markers (tone words, presence of specific
self-tags, no forbidden phrases). A worker compares replies to the
markers and flags drift. Catches the persona quietly drifting from
the sheet via prompt rot or memory contamination. Key files: new
`app/core/persona_regression_worker.py`, fixture file under
`data/persona/`, alert path that surfaces drift in the diagnostics
tab.

---

## K11. Counterfactual / pre-thought cache

G3 covers factual `open_question`s. A natural cousin is "what would I
say if Jacob asked me X" — Aiko occasionally drafts a reply to a
hypothetical and caches it in scratchpad memory, smoothing future
first responses without needing web access. Bounded queue, cheap LLM
call, scratchpad-tier so it ages out naturally if unused. Key files:
new `app/core/counterfactual_worker.py`,
[`app/core/memory/memory_store.py`](../../app/core/memory/memory_store.py) (new
`pre_thought` kind, scratchpad tier).

---

## K12. Calendar-linked anticipation

Combine H2 (time context) + D1 (reminders) + the temporal-memory
`future_plan` kind: if Aiko knows "Jacob has an interview Friday",
weight it higher as Friday approaches (e.g. score `+= 0.05` when
`event_time - now < 48h`). Mostly a retrieval-side change once the
temporal scaffolding is in. Key files:
[`app/core/rag/rag_retriever.py`](../../app/core/rag/rag_retriever.py),
[`app/core/proactive/follow_up_worker.py`](../../app/core/proactive/follow_up_worker.py)
(already nudges on overdue plans — extend to "approaching" plans).

## K13. Stylometric mirror

Shipped — see [`shipped.md`](shipped.md) "K13. Stylometric mirror
(Jacob-side typing register)".

---

## K14. Implicit engagement signals

Shipped — see [`shipped.md`](shipped.md) "K14. Implicit engagement
signals (latency + length)".

---

## K15. Self-disclosure / vulnerability budget

**Shipped** — see [shipped.md → K15](shipped.md#k15-self-disclosure--vulnerability-budget).

---

## K17. Clarification-repair protocol

Distinct from K8 (rupture-and-repair, which fires on affect drop
after Aiko's turn). K17 covers *semantic* repair — "no that's
not what I meant", "you misunderstood", a very short confused
reply, an explicit `huh?` — and triggers a one-turn "let me re-
read that" beat without waiting for affect drift. Pairs naturally
with K4 dialogue-act tagging: a `clarification` act on the user's
last message is the clean signal. Key files: new
`app/core/conversation/clarification_detector.py` (regex + optional dialogue-
act fallback), inner-life provider that adds a one-line "Jacob
just signalled you missed the point — re-read his last two
messages and say so plainly" hint,
[`data/persona/aiko_companion.txt`](../../data/persona/aiko_companion.txt)
"Reading {user_name}" section.

---

## K19. Cold-start companion onboarding

`FirstRunOnboarding` gates on display name only. Companion-AI
research stresses the first ~10 turns set the relational tone —
preferences, boundaries, a first shared moment, communication
style. A lightweight scripted arc (four to six conversational
prompts spread across the first session, *not* a form) seeds
`UserProfile` and `relationship_axes` with real data instead of
defaults, and gives Aiko's prompt a "we're still meeting" hint
that can soften her self-introduction cadence. Key files:
[`web/src/components/FirstRunOnboarding.tsx`](../../web/src/components/FirstRunOnboarding.tsx),
new `app/core/onboarding_director.py` (turn-counter + state
machine), persona addendum block when `turn_count < N`,
optionally `UserProfile` seed fields.

## K20. Metacognitive calibration

Shipped — see [`shipped.md`](shipped.md) "K20. Metacognitive
calibration — per-user trust scalar + topic slots".

---

## K21. Fresh-eyes thread re-summarisation

Compaction compresses history when context overflows; it doesn't
periodically re-synthesise "what this ongoing thread is *about*
now" for Aiko's inner voice. After ~50 turns or daily (whichever
comes first), an idle worker would draft a 3-sentence "current
state of this thread" note pinned to the session, separate from
the rolling summary. Improves long-thread coherence without
paying a per-turn token cost, and gives Aiko a clean place to
reset her read of where the conversation has actually gone. Key
files: new `app/core/thread_resummary_worker.py` adjacent to the
shipped `SummaryService` / `NarrativeWeaver`, inner-life provider
that prefers the fresh-eyes note over the rolling summary when
present, schema addition (a `thread_resummary` row per session or
a metadata field on the latest summary).

## K22. Callback / inside-joke detector

Shipped — see [`shipped.md`](shipped.md) "K22. Callback /
inside-joke detector (post-turn cosine pass + read-side bonus)".

**Shipped** — per-turn provider-time detector with shrink + pivot
triggers, cooldown, and MCP-debuggable bypass. See
[`shipped.md` → K23](shipped.md#k23-subtle-misattunement-detection).

## K24. Sensory anchoring layer

**Shipped** — adaptive per-arc cadence + posture-kind matrix.
See [`shipped.md` → K24](shipped.md#k24-sensory-anchoring-layer--adaptive-per-arc-cadence--posture-kind-matrix).

---

## K25. Memory confidence time-decay

**Shipped** — read-side `effective_confidence` with a new
`(distant)` suffix distinct from `(uncertain)` and `(faded)`. See
[`shipped.md` → K25](shipped.md#k25-memory-confidence-time-decay).

---

## K26. Aiko-side voice evolution

K13 reads Jacob's style and calibrates Aiko's register; nothing
symmetric exists for Aiko's *own* voice slowly absorbing the
shared lexicon. The `CatchphraseMiner` already detects phrases
that recur across *both* speakers — that's the right signal,
but today it only surfaces them as a "running jokes" block.
A slow, additive worker would let Aiko pick up 1-2 of those
phrases into her own toolkit over weeks (writes a
`voice_adoption` memory or `UserProfile` field). The persona
block then renders "phrases you've started to use yourself: …"
so the LLM can lean on them naturally without us hard-coding the
lexicon. Tiny effect per session, compounding over months — the
authenticity beat is "she's been around me long enough to talk
like me a little." Key files:
[`app/core/memory/catchphrase_miner.py`](../../app/core/memory/catchphrase_miner.py)
(extend to track *who* introduced each shared phrase first),
new `app/core/voice_adoption.py` (slow promotion rule), persona
block consumer.

"""Reaction vocabulary + semantic-neighbour fallback resolver.

Lives outside ``avatar_profile`` so the cadence/affect/text layers can
import the canonical reaction names without pulling in the avatar
loader. Previously co-located with ``persona_manager`` (deleted as
part of the Alexia bundling work).

The canonical 22-name set is what the affect/cadence pipelines emit
via ``[[reaction:X]]`` tags. ``_REACTION_SYNONYMS`` is fuzzy-match
material for personas where we have to *guess* a sensible default
mapping from expression filenames. ``_REACTION_NEIGHBOURS`` is the
fall-back chain used by :func:`resolve_reaction` when the loaded
avatar lacks a direct mapping for the requested reaction.

# Semantic-neighbour fallbacks. Used when a model's ``reaction_mapping``
# does not have an entry for a reaction the affect/cadence pipeline
# emitted. We walk the candidate list in order and return the first
# one that *is* mapped, so every reaction triggers *some* visual
# change even on minimal-expression models.
#
# Per-model overrides remain authoritative — this only fires when the
# requested reaction is missing from the explicit mapping.
#
# Design rule: NON-sad reactions must NEVER chain through ``concerned``
# / ``sad`` / ``melancholy`` / ``cry``. On rigs where those resolve to
# tear-streak overlays (e.g. Alexia's ``k`` = Param59), a single
# ``[[reaction:thoughtful]]`` emit (or the filler-injector's default
# "thoughtful" carry-over on a fresh-boot turn) would silently flip
# Aiko into "visibly crying" with no narrative justification. Stay
# inside the same emotional family — body-language layers carry the
# subtle texture instead. The sad family (``sad`` / ``melancholy`` /
# ``wistful`` / ``concerned`` / ``tired`` / ``cry``) chains among
# itself; that's where tear-streak overlays belong.
